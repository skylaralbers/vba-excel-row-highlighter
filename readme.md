# Excel Row Highlighter Macro

This VBA script highlights the last clicked row in Excel with a light blue fill color.  
The highlight persists even after clicking away from the sheet or switching windows.

Excel doesn’t include this feature by default—even though it should.  
This macro is especially useful when you’re entering or referencing data across multiple windows or applications while keeping Excel visible.  
It prevents losing track of your active row and saves time by keeping your position clearly marked.

##  File
**RowHighlighter.bas** — VBA module containing the macro.

##  How to Use
1. In Excel, press `Alt + F11`.
2. Open the desired sheet under “Microsoft Excel Objects.”
3. Go to **File → Import File...** and select `RowHighlighter.bas`.
4. Save as `.xlsm` and enable macros.
