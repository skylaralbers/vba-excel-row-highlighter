# Excel Row Highlighter Macro

This VBA script highlights the last clicked row in Excel with a light blue fill color and keeps it highlighted even after clicking away or switching windows.

Excel doesnâ€™t have this built inâ€”even though it should.  
This is extremely useful when youâ€™re entering data across multiple windows or referencing Excel while using other programs.  
It keeps your position visually locked so you never lose track of the active row.

Color can be changed by editing VBA macro's code in RGB values or specific name.
